    <h3>cranch lore</h3>
    <p>cranch was brought into this world long ago through the mind of some kind of jar jar binks and cher hybrid found at the depths of the cranch bogs</p>
    <h4>items needed to summon the cranch gods</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bottle of hidden valley ranch</li>
        <li>at least a clam full of cranch berries</li>
        <li>the blood of your sworn enemy(you can substitute this with cranberry sauce) </li>
        <li>your cranch vessel</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>how to summon the cranch lord 101</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>first you're gonna want to shake up the ranch real good while chanting the magic words. you know the ones</li>
        <li>after you've shaken your ranch vigorously you're gonna want to kiss your clam goodbye one last time</li>
        <li>toss the clam and cranch berries into the blood or sauce and chant more of the magic words</li>
        <li>you will now have to defeat the 2 headed sauce goblin (one head is gucci mane) with your cranch vessel</li>
        <li>after you have defeated the beast you must now scoop his remains and the rest of your ranch into the vessel</li>
     </ol>
     <h5>conclusion i think</h5>
     <p>if you have completed the steps above as shown then you should have a beautiful cranch to go with the pan fried chicken you made in the previous recipe.</p>
